Hi welcome to Yu Hangs Connect 4 simulation

Your Task:
    create a function that takes in a 6x7 list and your symbol and returns a column to insert your move
    input -> 6 x 7 board ("-" is empty slot), your symbol in string form
    output -> column integer from 0 to 6

    Empty board:

    - | - | - | - | - | - | -
    - | - | - | - | - | - | -
    - | - | - | - | - | - | -
    - | - | - | - | - | - | -
    - | - | - | - | - | - | -
    - | - | - | - | - | - | -
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
    
    conditions:
        your bot must only output integers from 0 - 6 and you CANNOT return a column that is already full or you will not pass the testcase

    objective:
        ensure that your bot has the best winrate against other strategies
    
HOW TO START:
    1. Scan through Main.py
    2. duplicate template.py and rename it
    3. write your function
    4. import your bot into the top of the main file
    5. enter $python main.py
